So this is a really sketchy h-bridge circuit that is capable of running the vibration motor in 2 different directions with 2 different button presses. Yeah, its kind of useless when i'm using a vibration motor and not an actual motor,

I hid the silkscreen over here because it got really cluttered but the silksceens are on the next images

since the least amount of pcbs I can buy is 5 I thought of just using the back to create some kind of dog tags of Jorge from halo reach.
