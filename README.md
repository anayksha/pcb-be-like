So this is a really sketchy h-bridge circuit that is capable of running the vibration motor in 2 different directions with 2 different button presses. Yeah, it's kind of useless when it's hooked up to a vibration motor and not an actual motor, but like I wanted to mess around with transistors and I lowk didn't know what else I could make that wasn't too simple nor too complex for me.

## PCB
I hid the silkscreens over here because it got really cluttered but the silksceens are on the next images<br>

Since the least amount of pcbs I can buy is 5, I wanted to do something with the extras, and so I thought of making the back silkscreen layer some kind of dog tags of Jorge from halo reach.<br>
